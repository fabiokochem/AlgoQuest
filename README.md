# Complex Algorithms (Algorithms and Data Structure)

Hello! You're welcome :) (If you're Brazilian and prefer to read this in Portuguese... just scroll down, but you should practice your english so don't do that!!)

Firstly, I would like to introduce the reason why I created this repository. I have always been fascinated by Data Structures, especially Graphs, since the first time I encountered them. I spent so much time researching and learning new things, but unfortunately, I never created a repository or published any of the projects I worked on GitHub (kind of silly, but it's okay—I'm fixing that now XD).

My intention here is to share everything I can related to Data Structures, Algorithm Design, and similar topics. This way, I can organize my ideas in one place where I can review them frequently, and hopefully, help you if you have any questions about something you find here!

## Metodology

Basically, I will provide a simple review of how the topic I'm discussing works (such as a data structure) in the easiest way possible. Along with that, you'll find my code, accompanied by a full explanation of my logic. Afterward, I’ll recommend some exercises related to the topic. These exercises will most likely be from LeetCode.

My biggest advice for you, if you want to excel in algorithms, is: stay active on LeetCode! Consistency and discipline will teach you so much, not just in coding but in life as well. :D

# Final Considerations 

I'm truly grateful if you really liked it and if could help you with something! If you want to talk about something or ask me any question, you can text me on linkedin any time. Have a good day :)

# Para os Brasileiros

Você realmente achou que eu ia colocar isso em português??? Pratique e use o tradutor do seu navegador caso você precise, mas tente ao máximo se adequar ao inglês porque os melhores conteúdos de programação sempre vão ser em inglês, você programa em inglês e o mundo da programação fala inglês!! Só falta você <3
